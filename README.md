# Glaucoma Screening Using Generative Adversarial Networks based Preserving discsâ€™ GeometricalPreserving Geometrical  Shape Layer
This method works on segmenting the optical discs while preserving the geometrical shape as preferred by doctors. Two GAN models were contributed in addition to the proposed PGS layer. the image below shows the effect of the proposed model in the segmentation of the optic disc/cup.

the rest of the details are coming soon.

# Dataset
The two publicly available datasets Drishti-GS1 and RimOne-v3 were used in this work.

# Prerequest
Coming soon.
